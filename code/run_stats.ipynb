Below we asked: holding out one of these fingerprints at a time, could we “match up” which participant it belonged to?  Specifically, we created two distributions of correlations.  The first distribution comprised “within-participant” correlations between the fingerprint from a held-out list and the average fingerprint from all remaining lists.  Each participant contributes a total of 16 correlations to this distribution.  The second distribution comprise  “across-participant” correlations between one the fingerprint from one held-out list from one participant, and the average fingerprints (across all lists) for each other participant.  We repeat these across-participant comparisons for each pairing of lists (from the “template” participant) and other participants.  Therefore each participant contributes $16 \\times (N - 1)$ correlations to this second distribution (one per list, times $N - 1$--- i.e., the number of participants excluding the template participant).
