# make a query and loop through
s = table.select()
rows = s.execute()

for row in rows:
    data.append(row[data_column_name])

# Now we have all participant datastrings in a list.
# Let's make it a bit easier to work with:

# parse each participant's datastring as json object
# and take the 'data' sub-object
data = [json.loads(part)['data'] for part in data if part is not None]

# insert uniqueid field into trialdata in case it wasn't added
# in experiment:
for part in data:
    for record in part:
#         print(record)
        if type(record['trialdata']) is list:

            record['trialdata'] = {record['trialdata'][0]:record['trialdata'][1]}
        record['trialdata']['uniqueid'] = record['uniqueid']

# flatten nested list so we just have a list of the trialdata recorded
# each time psiturk.recordTrialData(trialdata) was called.
def isNotNumber(s):
    try:
        float(s)
        return False
    except ValueError:
        return True

data = [record['trialdata'] for part in data for record in part]

# filter out fields that we dont want using isNotNumber function

# Put all subjects' trial data into a dataframe object from the
# 'pandas' python library: one option among many for analysis
